With didn't have time to talk about the optional topic in this course, section ANNs.
However, some might be intersted in to work in this area.

The file `main.c` is a C code written from scratch for a Neural Network with:
- 2 inputs and 2 outputs,
- 2 hidden layers, first and second with 40 and 20 neurons, respectively.

It reads the data.txt and trains the neural network. The eqaul code in Python is written in `ANN.ipynb`.

A complex programming practice can be:
1. printing and plotting the results, the way we have in Python
2. Use dynamic memory allocatuion, the stack is limited!
3. change the shape of neural network to be flexible like:
	a) being able to have muliple layers, not just 2
	b) being able to have multiple inputs not just 2
	c) being able to have multiple outputs not just 2


Before jumping to this project you need to study the section related to ANN, then if you have any questions you can contact me.

Good luck
